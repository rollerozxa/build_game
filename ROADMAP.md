# Build Game Roadmap/Vision/Goals
Think of it like [Dreambuilder](https://content.minetest.net/packages/VanessaE/dreambuilder_game/) but lighter, less bloated and without furniture or other advanced model blocks.

## Features
- Hundreds of material blocks that come with variants in all sorts of shapes and sizes.
	- All blocks are static and do nothing, even ones such as sand and water, allowing you to form them as you see fit.
- Powerful building tools to quickly and painlessly modify blocks in bulk. (worldedit,)
- Minimally lightweight with little to no survival elements to get in the way or create lag.

## What Build Game does not have...
- Anything that's too dynamic or interactive (mesecons, technic)
- Detailed furniture blocks or the like (homedecor)
- Regular survival items or crafting recipes (It is intended to be played primarily in creative)

## World compatibility
Build Game is intended to be more or less compatible with worlds initially created in Minetest Game. There are some things Build Game lacks (insects, items, some removed MTG blocks...) but most basic nodes should be compatible and transfer over.
