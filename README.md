# Build Game
A lightweight game centered around creative building with no survival elements and with a focus on basic building blocks.

It is based on Minetest Game, but stripped of any and all survival gameplay and aspects. In addition it also contains some more mods that provide more nodes and building tools. For more info see [CREDITS.md](https://github.com/rollerozxa/build_game/blob/master/CREDITS.md)

Build Game doesn't provide the regular MTG mods, but game-agnostic mods will work. Texture compatibility is kept to the original texture names, and world compatibility is kept to an extent (see [COMPAT.md](https://github.com/rollerozxa/build_game/blob/master/COMPAT.md) for more info).
